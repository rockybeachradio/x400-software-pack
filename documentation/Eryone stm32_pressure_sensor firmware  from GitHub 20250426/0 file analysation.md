# ./pressure_sensor.ioc
The file pressure_sensor.ioc is a STM32CubeMX project configuration file.

📌 Purpose
.ioc files are generated and used by STM32CubeMX (the graphical configuration tool from STMicroelectronics).
They describe the microcontroller setup: pins, peripherals, clock tree, watchdogs, interrupts, etc.
STM32CubeMX uses this file to generate C initialization code for STM32 microcontrollers.

## 🔍 What this specific file contains
MCU: STM32G030F6P6 (STM32G0 family, TSSOP20 package).
Peripherals enabled:
IWDG → Independent watchdog
NVIC → Interrupt controller setup
RCC → Reset and clock control
SYS → System core
USART2 → Serial communication
Pins configured: PA0, PA1, PA2, PA3, PA4, PA5, PA13, PA14/BOOT0, PA15
Clocks and interrupts → SysTick, HardFault, etc.

## ️ Usage in your project
This file is not compiled directly.
Instead:
You open it with STM32CubeMX.
CubeMX shows you a pinout + configuration GUI.
When you click Generate Code, it produces the Src/ and Inc/ C files that initialize the MCU for your project (in this case, a pressure sensor firmware).

## ✅ So:
This file is basically the blueprint for your STM32-based pressure sensor firmware.
It ensures that if you (or anyone else) re-open the project in CubeMX, the same pin mappings and peripheral setup will be used, and you can regenerate consistent C code.





# ./core/Inc/file cs1237.h
The file cs1237.h is a C header file for working with the CS1237 ADC chip.

## 📌 What is the CS1237?
The CS1237 is a 24-bit ΔΣ (delta-sigma) ADC (analog-to-digital converter) commonly used in weight scales, pressure sensors, and precision measurement circuits.
It has built-in PGA (programmable gain amplifier) and can operate at different sampling rates.

## 📂 What the header provides
This header defines:
- Function prototypes to control the chip:
´´´c
void CS1237_Init_JX(void);
void CS1237_Config(void);
unsigned char Read_Config(void);
int Read_CS1237(void);
void init_cs1237(int del_time, unsigned char reg_val);
unsigned long read_cs1237_data(void);
unsigned char rw_cs1237_cofig(unsigned char cmd, unsigned char data);
´´´
→ Functions for initialization, configuration, and reading data from the ADC.
- Delay functions (probably implemented elsewhere):
```c
void Delay1us(void);
void Delay1ms(void);
void delay_ms(int ms);
```
- Configuration macros for the chip’s registers:
```c
#define CS1237_REF(x)   (x<<6)  // reference voltage
#define CS1237_SPEED(x) (x<<4)  // sample rate: 10Hz, 40Hz, 640Hz, 1280Hz
#define CS1237_PGA(x)   (x<<2)  // gain: 1, 2, 64, 128
#define CS1237_CH(x)    (x<<0)  // input channel
```

## ⚙️ Purpose in your project
This file is not executable code, but the interface to talk to the CS1237 ADC chip.
It is used together with a cs1237.c source file (not uploaded here) that actually implements these functions.
Likely tied into your pressure_sensor.ioc project → meaning your STM32 reads analog pressure data through the CS1237 ADC.

## ✅ In short:
cs1237.h is the driver header file for integrating the CS1237 24-bit ADC into your STM32 firmware — so you can read precise analog data (pressure, weight, etc.) through I²C/SPI-like GPIO communication.





# ./core/Src/cs1237.c
Your cs1237.c file is the C driver implementation for the CS1237 24-bit ADC chip.
It works together with the header file cs1237.h you uploaded before.

## 📌 Purpose
This file provides the low-level functions to initialize, configure, and read data from the CS1237 ADC using an STM32 microcontroller (in your case an STM32G030).
The CS1237 is often used in pressure sensors, load cells, and precision measurement devices.

## 🔍 Key parts of the file
- Pin definitions
´´´c
PA0 → CS1237 CLK
PA1 → CS1237 Dout
´´´
These GPIOs simulate a clock + data line to talk to the ADC.

- GPIO helpers
Functions like OUT_IN() and OUT_OUT() configure the Dout pin dynamically as input or output, depending on whether you’re writing config or reading data.

- Delay functions
´´´c
void Delay1us(void);
void Delay1ms(void);
void delay_ms(int ms);
´´´
Used to generate precise timing for the ADC’s serial protocol.

- Initialization
´´´c
void CS1237_Init_JX(void);
void init_cs1237(int del_time, unsigned char reg_val);
´´´
Sets up GPIO and writes initial configuration into the ADC.

- Configuration
´´´c
void CS1237_Config(void);
unsigned char rw_cs1237_cofig(unsigned char cmd, unsigned char data);
unsigned char Read_Config(void);
´´´
Allows writing or reading the CS1237’s config registers (sample rate, gain, input channel, etc.).

- Data reading
´´´c
int32_t Read_CS1237(void);
unsigned long read_cs1237_data(void);
´´´
    - Reads 24-bit signed data from the ADC.
    - Converts two’s complement into a signed integer.
    - Returns the digital value representing the analog sensor input (e.g. pressure).

## ⚙️ In your project
This driver is meant to be used in your pressure sensor firmware (the .ioc file you showed earlier sets up the STM32 pins).
The main program would call:
´´´c
init_cs1237(100, 0x2C);  // initialize with delay + config value
while (1) {
    int pressure_raw = Read_CS1237();
    // convert raw value to calibrated pressure
}
´´´
The raw values can then be scaled into physical units (e.g. bar, psi).

## ✅ In short:
cs1237.c is the low-level driver code that bit-bangs GPIOs on your STM32 to talk to the CS1237 ADC chip, configure it, and fetch high-precision measurement data for your pressure sensor project.
